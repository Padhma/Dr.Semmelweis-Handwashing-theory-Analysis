# Dr.Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing 

Ignaz Semmelweis (1818-65) Ignaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician whose work demonstrated that hand-washing could drastically reduce the number of women dying after childbirth. This work took place in the 1840s, while he was Director of the maternity clinic at the Vienna General Hospital in Austria.

This project aims to analyze the birthrates and the deathrates of the clinic where Dr.Semmelweis worked and provides a detailed analysis as to why he thought handwashing could reduce deathrates.
